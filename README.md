# Beginner MERN Projects 
In this repo I am going to develop some projects which are for beginner level , from which I will develop a complete understanding of CRUD operations, basic routing, and state management in React with Node.js/Express backends connected to MongoDB

## To-Do List App:
Building this app teaches core CRUD operations across the full MERN stack, starting with MongoDB schema design for tasks (fields like title, description, completed status, userId). You'll implement a Node.js/Express backend with REST APIs (/tasks GET/POST/PUT/DELETE), Mongoose for data modeling and queries, and user authentication using JWT for protected routes to ensure task persistence per user.​

On the frontend, master React fundamentals: functional components, useState/useEffect hooks for local state and API calls via Axios, conditional rendering for task lists, and form handling for add/edit. Integrate React Router for basic navigation (e.g., /login, /dashboard), plus error handling and loading states to build responsive UIs. Deployment reinforces environment variables for secrets like JWT keys and MongoDB URI.

## Personal Portfolio Website:
This project focuses on dynamic, responsive frontend development with React, teaching component reusability (e.g., ProjectCard, ContactForm) and state lifting for form submissions that POST to a backend API storing messages in MongoDB. You'll design schemas for projects (title, description, link, image) and skills, using Express to serve JSON data fetched by React's useEffect.​

Key learnings include CSS-in-JS or Tailwind for responsive layouts (media queries, flex/grid), React Router for multi-page SPA feel (/home, /projects, /contact), and form validation with libraries like Formik/Yup before backend persistence. Backend covers CORS setup for frontend-backend communication and basic middleware for request logging, enhancing skills in content management without a CMS

## Weather App: 
Develop API integration skills by consuming external services like OpenWeatherMap API for real-time data (current/forecast), parsing JSON responses in React with useEffect/fetch/Axios, and displaying via components (SearchBar, WeatherCard with icons/charts). Backend introduces MongoDB for user favorites (location, saved cities), with endpoints for personalized storage/retrieval.​

You'll learn advanced state management with useContext or Redux for global app state (e.g., user location, saved list), geolocation API for auto-detecting position, and error resilience (API fallbacks, offline handling). Additional features cover data visualization with Recharts or Chart.js for temperature trends, plus environment-based API keys, preparing for real-world async data flows and user-specific persistence.

for these project I am not following any tutorial I will take help of documentation If anyone want to use these project for the learning purpose then follow me , like the project repo and code is all yours
